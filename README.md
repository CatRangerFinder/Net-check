# NetCheck
> [!NOTE]
> Since I'm still new to coding in general, its expected there maybe be bugs and unexpected behavior in the script if you think its doing something its not ment to, make a issues to let me know!


## What does it do?
Depends on which script you run currently I plan to make all these work as one and use them in docker but they can work seperately.

### dns_check:
"dns_check" If ran on its own checks DNS resolve times and gives you a warning if main DNS is down. (I check this by seeing if its over 2 seconds as thats when DNS times out)

### speed_test:
"speed_test" When ran seperately will check the ping, download speeds and upload speeds of the computer its run on.

## How to deploy (Instructions coming later in devolopment)
